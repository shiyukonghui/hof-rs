//      section 8.1). The scratch name is inserted *before* the extension, so the
//      saver still sees `tres`;
//   2. the name is plain and deterministic (no leading dot, no per-call random
//      suffix), so it is visible in a directory listing, overwritten by the next
//      call and removed on every path. A hidden or per-call-unique name was tried
//      and rejected: Godot's `ResourceSaver::save()` runs its `save_callback` for
//      `res://` paths *before* the caller renames the file, so the editor's
//      resource filesystem records the scratch path either way and leaves a

// Section-granular `project.godot` publish (TASK-059 D-4). The engine half is
// TASK-057 patch 2: `ProjectSettings::save_custom_section()`.
//
// The whole-file writer above regenerates `project.godot` out of the in-memory
// settings: it writes the engine's own fixed header and re-emits every setting,
// so every hand written comment in the file is lost (`_save_settings_text()`,
// `core/config/project_settings.cpp:1170-1210`). For a call that changes exactly
// one setting that loss is needless, and since TASK-057 the engine can do
// better: `save_custom_section()` rewrites **only** the named section and copies
// every other byte of the file through - comments, blank lines, key order, a
// UTF-8 BOM and CRLF line endings included
// (`core/config/project_settings.h:209-241`, `project_settings.cpp:1537-1779`).
//
// The key's section is the part before its **first** `/`
// (`_get_property_list()` splits on the first separator, `project_settings.cpp:
// 1312-1319`), which is also the rule `save_custom_section()` enforces on its
// `p_custom` argument (`project_settings.cpp:1552-1554`).
//
// `r_whole_file` is the honesty channel for the declared fall-backs. It is set
// to `true` exactly when the whole-file writer did the publish - i.e. when the
// comments in the file were destroyed. The four cases, all of them things the
// section writer cannot serve, are named in the contract descriptions of the
// tools that call this:
//
//   1. the key names **no** section: it has no `/`, or its `/` is the first
//      character. `_save_settings_text()` writes such a key into the header-less
//      global block at the top of the file (`category = ""`, `:1314-1315`), and
//      that block has no section name to hand `save_custom_section()`;
//   2. the destination **does not exist yet**: `save_custom_section()` publishes
//      *into* a file and never creates one (`ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `:1685-1689`),
//      while the whole-file writer does create it. The fall-back is what keeps
//      the pre-TASK-059 behaviour of that case;
//   3. the **engine refuses** the section write: a section name carrying `[`,
//      `]` or a line break, a value it cannot serialize, or a file it cannot read
//      back (`:1540-1558`, `:1691-1710`). The whole-file writer is then the only
//      writer that can still produce the requested end state;
//   4. the file already carries the same setting name in its header-less **global
//      block**. `ConfigFile` names that block with the empty section string
//      (`core/io/config_file.cpp:282/298`), and `ProjectSettings` resolves a
//      `section/key` line written there to the very setting name a section
//      publish is about to write - so a section publish would leave a stale
//      duplicate line behind instead of normalising it the way the whole-file
//      writer does. A file that cannot be read as a config file at all counts as
//      this case: surgery on a file the engine's own reader rejects is not
//      attempted.
//
// What this deliberately does **not** do: remove a key.
// `update_settings_section_text()` never deletes one (`project_settings.h:
// 226-227`), so a tool that clears a setting (`project_remove_autoload`) stays on
// the whole-file writer and says so in its own description.

// `project.godot`'s `[input]` section (added by TASK-041 section 2; the
// RACING-FINDINGS M-6 / RACING-DEV-LOG E-4 capability gap).
//
// `editor_add_input_action` wrote only the editor process' `InputMap` singleton:
// the action was live in that one process and nowhere else, so a running game
// could never see it. The engine's own bridge between the two worlds is the
// `[input]` section of `project.godot`:
// `InputMap::load_from_project_settings()` (`core/input/input_map.cpp:325-358`)
// rebuilds the map at startup from every `input/<action>` entry, where an entry
// is a Dictionary with `"deadzone"` and `"events"` - and an entry **without**
// `"events"` is skipped. These helpers are that bridge:
//
//   * the value is built from the live **map**, not from the request, so what is
//     published is the action's real state (its `deadzone` included) and a second
//     identical call publishes the same bytes (idempotent);
//   * the publish goes through `publish_project_setting_to()`, i.e. the engine's
//     own `save_custom_section()` (TASK-059 D-4), which replaces the target
//     section through a temporary sibling plus a backup and a rename, so
//     `project.godot` is never truncated by a failed publish **and** every byte
//     outside `[input]` - hand written comments included - is preserved. The
//     whole-file writer is still the declared fall-back (see the four cases
//     above); it is the writer that creates the file when it does not exist yet;
//   * `r_persisted` is the result of **reading the file back off disk**: the
//     published bytes are parsed with `ConfigFile` (the engine's own reader, with
//     objects allowed - `core/io/config_file.cpp:289`) and compared with what was

//
// `editor_analyze_screenshot_diff` was the module's only pixel-by-pixel
// comparison, as a body inside `tools/editor_testing_read.cpp`. TASK-044 adds
// the **call capture** (`mcp_capture.cpp`), which has to answer the same
// question - "did this picture change?" - about the before/after pair it took
// around one tool call. Two implementations of "the same" comparison is exactly
// the drift GDR-25 forbids (the same rule TASK-011 applied to the PNG writer),
// so the loop itself moved here and both callers use it.
//
// What is *not* here, deliberately: the argument handling of the tool
// (`image_a`/`image_b` as path-or-base64, the 0..255 threshold rule, the axis
// cap and the `-32603` of a PNG that cannot be encoded). Those are one caller's
// contract, and the other caller has no arguments at all.
//
// The body is a verbatim move of the tool's loop: the same `Color::get_r8`
// bytes (the GDScript `Color.r8` spelling the threshold is defined in), the same
// `MAX(dr, MAX(dg, db)) > threshold` test, the same difference colours, the same
// `Math::snapped(.., 0.01)` rounding of the percentage. The one addition is
// `p_build_diff_image`: the capture path does not draw a difference picture
// unless it was asked to, and drawing it is the expensive half of the loop.
//
// TASK-045 added a **raw-byte fast path** to the same function: when both images
// share a size *and* one of the six 8-bit formats whose `Image::get_pixel`
// decode is a plain `byte / 255.0` (`FORMAT_L8`, `FORMAT_LA8`, `FORMAT_R8`,
// `FORMAT_RG8`, `FORMAT_RGB8`, `FORMAT_RGBA8`), the walk reads
// `Image::get_data()` - a reference, not a copy (`core/io/image.h:392`) - and
// compares the bytes directly. For those formats `Color::get_r8()`
// (`core/math/color.h:233`: `clamp(round(c * 255.0f), 0, 255)`) answers the raw
// byte itself for every one of the 256 values, which is what makes the two paths
// bit-identical; `tests/test_mcp_server.h` proves that exhaustively and diffs
// the two paths' difference pictures byte for byte. Every other format (float,
// half, 16-bit, the packed 4444/565 forms, compressed) keeps the original
// per-pixel loop, so no format's behaviour changes - including the engine's own
// "Can't get_pixel() on compressed image" refusal.

//   * a composite **component** -> `running_game_node_write.cpp`'s component
//     table (`ValueSlot::REAL_T` / `ValueSlot::FLOAT32` / `ValueSlot::INT32`);
//   * a packed **element**      -> `coerce_to_property_type`'s element half
//     (`UINT8` / `INT32` / `REAL_T` / `FLOAT32`, `WIDE` for the 64-bit
//     containers);
//   * a `ProjectSettings` value -> `ValueSlot::WIDE`: settings are stored as
//     Variants, not in typed C++ members, so nothing is narrowed.

// GDR-24 (TASK-023 D-7), the fourth shape of the same defect, is **not** a new

	// `coerce_to_property_type`'s default.

	// The slot is exactly as wide as the Variant type the conversion relation
	// already judged: a `double` member, an `int64_t` member, a
	// `PackedFloat64Array`/`PackedInt64Array` element, a `ProjectSettings`
	// value (stored as a Variant), a String. Nothing to add.
	WIDE,
	// A `real_t`: a `float` in a single-precision build (this one), a `double`
	// otherwise. Used for `FLOAT` members, `Vector2`/`Vector3`/`Vector4`
	// components and `PackedFloat32Array` elements *in a build whose `real_t` is
	// a `float`* - the packed case is `FLOAT32` below, because its element is
	// always a `float`.
	REAL_T,
	// A **`float` regardless of the build's `real_t`** (GDR-24, TASK-023 D-15):
	// a `Color` component (`core/math/color.h:39-42` declares `float r,g,b,a`)
	// and a `PackedFloat32Array` element (`PackedFloat32Array::operator[]` is a
	// `float`). Before this slot existed both were judged as `REAL_T`, whose
	// `#ifdef REAL_T_IS_DOUBLE` branch accepted everything - so in a
	// `precision=double` build `{"r":1e300}` would have been written as
	// `Color(inf,0,0,1)` and a packed float32 element as `inf`, exactly the
	// silent wrong value this gate exists to remove. The judgement is therefore

// The slot a **property member** of `p_target_type` is stored in: `REAL_T` for a

//
// The `INT` answer is deliberately `WIDE`, and that is the honest boundary of
// this gate rather than an omission: `PropertyInfo` carries a Variant type, not a
// C++ width, so an `int` member cannot be told from an `int64_t` member from the
// outside. Guessing "every INT member is 32-bit" would refuse legitimate 64-bit
// members, and the alternative - the engine's own clamping - is already reported
// honestly by every path here (the answer carries the value `Object::get()` reads
// back after the write, which the M4b audit confirmed for `z_index`). The one
// place the width *is* knowable is a container element or a component, and both
// go through the same `value_fits_slot`.
ValueSlot scalar_member_slot(Variant::Type p_target_type);

// True when `p_value` survives a copy into a slot of width `p_slot`.
//
// `p_value` is an already-typed value (the output of the type conversion), so
// this function judges **only** the width: a `double` that does not survive being
// narrowed to a `float` (overflow to `inf`, or a non-zero value underflowing to
// `0`), an integer outside `int32_t`/`uint8_t`. On a refusal `r_error` is a
// `-32602` that names the parameter, states the value the engine's own copy
// would have stored and gives the acceptable range; `p_slot_context` names the
// slot in the caller's own words ("the 32-bit float component this property
// stores"), so one message shape still tells the caller *where* the value was
// going.
//
// A `WIDE` slot accepts everything, and so does a `REAL_T` slot in a
// double-precision build (the member really is a `double`): this function never
// refuses a value the C++ member can really hold. A `FLOAT32` slot is judged as
// 32 bits **whatever the build is** (GDR-24).

		const String &p_slot_context, MCPToolError &r_error);

// The value handed to `Object::set()`, coerced to the property's own type.
//
// `VariantUtilityFunctions::type_convert` is exactly the engine's own
// `@GlobalScope.type_convert` (the conversion the GDScript `Object.set()` path
// ends up in). Non-finite numbers are refused explicitly: converting `inf` to an
// integer is undefined behaviour, not a conversion. `p_parameter_name` names the
// caller's argument in the refusal message, so every caller keeps its own
// wording (`properties` / `resource_properties` / `value`).
//
// TASK-018 section 1: the second refusal. `type_convert` is *not* the engine's
// own conversion relation - `Variant::can_convert` is - and for every pair the
// relation does not list, `type_convert` reaches a `Variant::operator <T>()`
// whose `else` branch is the **default-constructed** `<T>`. That is how
// `{"position": 1e20}` answered `status: ok` while really writing `Vector2(0,0)`
// (`Variant::operator Vector2()` has no FLOAT case, variant.cpp:1790), and the
// same silent-default shape exists for every struct/composed target (Vector2i,
// Vector3, Rect2, Transform2D, Color from a FLOAT, an ARRAY from a scalar, ...).
// When `can_convert(p_value's type, p_target_type)` is false the value cannot
// fall into the target type at all, so it is refused with `-32602` here - in the
// one place every write path of the module goes through - and nothing is written.
//
// TASK-020 sections 1 and 2 add the two remaining silent-default surfaces the M4
// acceptance measured, both *inside* a pair `can_convert` declares convertible:
//
//   * `STRING -> FLOAT/INT` (`can_convert` answers true for every string, and
//     `String::to_float("abc")` answers `0`), so a string that does not, as a
//     whole, spell the number the target type receives is refused instead of
//     written as `0`. The `#rrggbb` colour string is a different pair and is
//     untouched;
//   * an `ARRAY` element of a packed container target: the element type is pushed
//     through this same function, so `[{"x":"abc","y":1}]` for a
//     `PackedVector2Array` and `["abc"]` for a `PackedFloat64Array` are refused
//     rather than folded into `(0,0)` / `0.0` by the element conversion.
//
// TASK-021 closes the three surfaces of the same family that TASK-020 recorded as
// residual:
//
//   * `STRING -> BOOL`: `can_convert` lists the pair, and the conversion behind
//     it (`Variant::booleanize()`) answers `true` for **every non-empty string**,
//     so `visible: "abc"` / `"false"` / `"0"` all wrote `true`. A string is now
//     accepted only when it spells a boolean (`"true"`/`"false"`/`"1"`/`"0"`,
//     case insensitive for the words) and the value written is the boolean the
//     spelling names;
//   * the **element width** of a packed container: the element gate judged the
//     element's Variant *type*, not the width of the slot it is copied into, so
//     `PackedByteArray` wrote `300` as `44` and `-1` as `255`, `PackedInt32Array`
//     truncated a 64-bit integer and `PackedFloat32Array` wrote `inf`/`0` for
//     `1e300`/`1e-300` - all next to a success. An element that does not fit is
//     now `-32602`;
//   * `STRING -> COLOR`: `Color(const String &)` answers `Color()` (black) for a
//     string that is neither an HTML code nor a named colour, so
//     `modulate: "notacolor"` wrote black. Only the two grammars the engine's own
//     constructor really reads are accepted now (`Color::html_is_valid` or
//     `Color::find_named_color`).
// TASK-022 makes the width judgement a step of this function itself, so that no
// write path can reach `Object::set()` without it. `p_slot` is the width of the
// C++ member the converted value is about to be copied into; its default,
// `ValueSlot::FROM_TARGET_TYPE`, is the property-member rule (`FLOAT` -> the
// `real_t` of this build, everything else as declared). A caller whose storage is
// not a member of the declared type passes an explicit slot - `WIDE` for a
// `ProjectSettings` value, `REAL_T`/`INT32`/`UINT8` for a slot the caller knows
// is narrower - and the element half below passes the container's element slot.
// See `ValueSlot` above for the one-place rule this implements (GDR-22).
//
// TASK-027 D-8: `p_expected_class` is the class the *property* declares for its
// Object value (see `object_property_class_hint`), when the caller knows it. The

// TASK-022 D-6: the cross-process test-report bridge (file IPC).
//
// **The defect.** `editor_get_test_report` is editor-scope, and *every* caller of
// `record_test_result` (`running_game_assertion.cpp:160`/`:242`,
// `running_game_test_execution.cpp:466`) lives in a game-scope tool, which is not
// registered on the editor endpoint at all (a cross-endpoint call is a `-32601`
// and never runs). The editor's accumulator is therefore a table nothing can
// write to: the M4b re-audit measured `total: 0` for every possible sequence of
// calls, i.e. the contract's "get the test report" capability was unreachable
// from a client no matter what it did.
//
// **The decision (the task book's, section 4): the file bridge, no contract
// change.** The migration source did the same thing - it handed the report
// between its processes over a `user://` file - so this is not a new mechanism
// invented for the occasion. The game process persists its accumulator; the
// editor-side tool reads the file:
//
//   * every `record_test_result` rewrites the whole accumulator to
//     `test_report_bridge_path()` **atomically** (`publish_file_atomically`: a
//     sibling temporary file is published with a rename, so a reader never sees
//     half a report);
//   * `editor_get_test_report` answers from that file when it is there, and says
//     so (`source: "game_process_file"`, plus the path and the write time);
//   * when the file is absent or holds no records the answer is the *honest*
//     empty report (`total: 0`, `no_results: true`) with
//     `report_file_present: false` - a `total` is never invented;
//   * `clear` (the tool's flag, default true) empties the **editor process'**
//     accumulator *and* removes the bridge file, so "the next call starts from
//     nothing" holds across processes; the answer's `cleared` list says which of
//     the two was really touched. The game process' memory cannot be reached from
//     the editor and is not claimed to be: the game re-persists its own full list
//     on its next recorded assertion.
//
// The accumulator semantics are therefore: **one in-memory list per process, and
// one `user://` file carrying the game process' list to the editor process.** It
// is not a memory read of the other process and cannot be.

// compares the live `inputSchema` field by field. This returns a copy of

// again; every other character is untouched, and a name the schema does not
// declare is skipped rather than invented.

// group's file-private helper (PLAYBOOK section 2.4), so there is one definition

// indent becomes one tab, a `func` at column 0 is lifted to class level with the
// blank/tab-indented lines that belong to it, everything else is indented into
// `_mcp_execute`), same `extends RefCounted` prelude, same deliberate
// untyped `func _mcp_execute():`. `running_game_execute_gdscript`'s doctest and
// its wire evidence pin the move as behaviour preserving.

// without it (where the annotation is unnecessary and the generated source
// stays byte-identical to the one TASK-010's evidence pinned). Measured on the
// wire before the fix: every `editor_execute_gdscript` call answered `-32602
// "does not compile: OK"` - `reload()` succeeded, so the message was nonsense,
// and the real reason was this predicate.
