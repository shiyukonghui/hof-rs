// TASK-018 section 3, group `project_cross_scene_write` of
// docs/tool-groups-b3.json: one property written into every scene that contains
// a node of a given type.
//
//   project_set_node_property_across_scenes   (old `cross_scene_set_property`,
//                                              batch.rs:257)
//
// channel `project`, `scope = both`, `mutating = true`. It is alone because it
// owns the multi-scene transaction.
//
// ## The transaction, stated up front
//
// The tool is **all-or-nothing**, in two phases, and neither phase can leave a
// half-written project behind:
//
//   * **plan (no writes).** Every `.tscn` under `path_filter` is loaded, every
//     node matching `type` is resolved, and the property is validated *per node*
//     through `MCPTools::prepare_node_property_value()` - the same rule the node
//     write uses. A scene that cannot be loaded, a matched node that does not
//     declare the property, or a value that cannot fall into the property's type
//     (TASK-018 section 1) refuses the **whole call** with `data.scenes`
//     naming every offending file, and nothing is written anywhere. This is the
//     "deliberately broken middle file" case of the task book, and it is a
//     refusal rather than a skip: skipping is how a caller ends up believing a
//     30-scene edit happened while one scene silently kept its old value.
//   * **commit (all files or none).** The original bytes of every target file
//     are read first, then each scene is packed and published atomically
//     (`publish_file_atomically`, so a single file cannot be truncated either).
//     If any publish fails, every file already published is restored **from those
//     bytes**, and the answer is `-32603` with `data.rollback` listing what was
//     put back.
//
// `dry_run` defaults to `not force` and the default is answered in the result,
// so "preview" is the default and a write needs an explicit `force: true,
// dry_run: false` (the migration source's rule, batch.rs:283-285).
//
// ## Divergences from the migration source, which the report lists
//
//   * the migration skipped a matched node that did not declare the property
//     (`if property in node`, batch.rs:396); here that refuses the call, because
//     the caller named `type` + `property` and a matched node that cannot take it
//     is a fact the caller has to know;
//   * the migration skipped any scene that failed to load
//     (`if packed == null: continue`, batch.rs:316-318) and answered a success;
//     here it is an error naming the file;
//   * the migration wrote through `ResourceSaver::save()` straight into the
//     destination (batch.rs:341) with no rollback across files;
//   * a `type` that is not a class at all produced `total_nodes: 0` as a
//     success (`_collect_scene_files` + a match that could never fire); here it
//     is `-32602`;
//   * the scene-file list is **sorted**, where the migration used
//     `DirAccess` iteration order (PLAYBOOK section 6.8: a non-deterministic
//     order is not an answer, and `scenes_affected` is part of the answer).

// caller owns and must not delete). Validates each value first, reads the current
// value before writing it, writes every node, reads every write back and compares
// it with the value that was written; the moment one step fails, every node this
// call already changed is restored to the value it held before, and `r_error`
// (with `data.live_nodes_restored`) says what happened.
//
// Public (not `static`) for the reason the node write helpers are: the doctest
// binary has no `SceneTree`, so the live write - including its read-back - can
// only be asserted through an entry point that takes the nodes directly.
