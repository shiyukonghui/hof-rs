# REBUILT-2C MANIFEST — 2c-3 (`H:\rebuild\godot`, branch `feature/mcp-server-module-rebuild`)

* Task: TASK-084 (2c-3) — push the reconstructed `modules/mcp_server` toward a green build.
* Start HEAD: `be6aa88c8c` (== `origin/feature/mcp-server-module-rebuild`).
* Every fragment below is either **recorded text** replayed at its recorded position, or a
  **mechanical call-site alignment** to an already-declared/wording-identical sibling. Where a
  fragment had to be written rather than replayed it is wrapped in
  `// [REBUILT-2C low-confidence: verify] ... // [/REBUILT-2C]` in the code and marked
  `REBUILT` in the table.

## Evidence sources used (this is the change of method versus TASK-083)

| source | what it gives | how it was used |
|---|---|---|
| `staging\__payload-index\events-read.jsonl` | per-revision read windows (`totalLines`, numbered `lines`) | line-number skeleton, byte-comparison against the tree |
| `staging\__payload-index\events-write.jsonl` | **whole recorded file contents** | replay base (`rec.py`) |
| `staging\__payload-index\events-edit.jsonl` | **every edit's full OLD and NEW text** | exact text for the dropped spans (`ev.py`) |
| `work\task084\{probe,windows,search,igrep,ev,layout,rgn,showdiff,rec,buflen,bal}.py` | the forensics tooling | see "Reproduce" below |

TASK-083 chose a "read epoch" base and reported 4 files as **unrecoverable**. That conclusion is
refuted: `events-edit.jsonl` stores the full `new` text of every edit, so the dropped spans are
recorded text, not a guess. `work\task084\rec.py` rebuilds a file from the newest recorded
whole-file write plus every later recorded edit, and fills the uncovered runs of the newest
revision skeleton from that replay.

## Files changed

| # | file | lines | what was done | basis | behaviour risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/project_cross_scene_write.h` | insert 4 lines after 36 | restore `class Node;` + its 2-line comment + blank | rev156 window lines 37–40, **byte-identical**, and the same forward declaration is the module's own idiom (`running_game_node_write.h:40`, `tool_helpers.h:48`) | none — restores the declaration; removes the `int MCPTools::Node/String/Variant` cascade |
| 2 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/editor_node_batch_write.cpp` | replace 75–190 (116), 350–354 (5), 415–429 (15) | replay the recorded whole-file write `seq=274` + all 13 later edits; every diff hunk must fall inside an **uncovered** run of rev766 (asserted) | `events-write seq=274` + `events-edit` (incl. `seq=267`, 272, 277, 282, 287, 292, 686) | none — recorded text; the replaced 84–149 was a stale pre-TASK-051 duplicate and 415–429 was a `set_node_property_batch_on` fragment spliced into `add_nodes_batch_on` |
| 3 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/tool_helpers.h` | replace 1124–1130 (7) with 72 lines, then 9 with 19 | replay `seq=810` (4-argument `build_execute_gdscript_source`, `struct GDScriptReloadReport`, `reload_gdscript_capturing`) and `seq=860` (`gdscript_reload_failure_text`) | `events-edit seq=810 t=1790298746575`, `seq=860 t=1790298785652`, both applied in time order | none — recorded text; the stale 3-argument duplicate further down becomes an overload, still compiling |
| 4 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/editor_input_simulation.cpp` | insert 21 lines before the "Event construction" header | replay the recorded `_number_fits_event` definition + its TASK-023 D-7 comment | `events-edit seq=324 t=1790093826031`, verbatim | none — recorded text |
| 5 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/editor_control_layout_write.cpp` | 123 | `_relative_path(` → `relative_path(` | hoist recorded in `events-edit seq=367` NEW ("is `MCPTools::relative_path`"); declared at `tool_helpers.h:608` | none — same signature, same semantics, the file-local copy no longer exists |
| 6 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/editor_node_write.cpp` | 383 | `_optional_dictionary(` → `optional_dictionary(` | hoist recorded in `events-edit seq=387/397` NEW ("It is `MCPTools::optional_dictionary`"); declared at `tool_helpers.h:736` | none — same signature |
| 7 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/editor_read_scene_inspector.cpp` | 225, 322, 382 | `_require_editor_ui(r_error)` → `require_editor_ui(r_error, "<wording>", "<hint>")` | `events-edit seq=713/470/431` NEW states the guard "is called below as `require_editor_ui(r_error, <non-editor wording>, <suggestion>)`"; the exact wording is the one the **same group** already uses at `editor_node_read.cpp:467` | **low**: the two literal strings are chosen from the sibling group, not read out of this file (no recorded edit rewrites these three call sites) |
| 8 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/editor_write_scene_editor.cpp` | 760 | same 1-argument → 3-argument alignment | same recorded NEW text; wording from the same file's own line 211 | **low**: same caveat as #7 |
| 9 | `modules/mcp_server/tools/editor_node_setup.cpp` | 794–798 → 1 line | **REBUILT**: the body of `if (!optional_float(p_args, "agent_height", …))` had been replaced by a whole register-tool block; restored to the sibling body `return Variant();` | the identical register block already exists at 873–878; every other `optional_*` check in the same function answers `return Variant();` (`781/785/789/797/800`) | none — restores the documented body of an already-present check; marked in code |

## Examined and deliberately **not** changed (the TASK-083 §5.3 diagnosis for these was wrong)

| file | finding |
|---|---|
| `modules/mcp_server/tools/tool_helpers.h` (the "87 errors at line 83") | The file is **byte-identical to its newest read window** over the whole covered range (842/842 lines, `cmp.py`). Line 83's `C2371 MCPTools::String: redefinition` was a *cascade* of file #1 (MSVC's `note:` points at `project_cross_scene_write.h(118)`). No head was lost. |
| `modules/mcp_server/tools/running_game_node_write.h` (the "22 errors at line 59") | byte-identical to rev216 (216/216 lines, `cmp.py`); the same cascade. |
| `modules/mcp_server/tools/tool_builder.h`, `tools/editor_node_setup.h`, `tools/project.cpp` | the tree already equals the reconstruction; their errors are not splice damage. |

## Result (measured, same counter on both logs — `recount84.py`)

| build | error lines | files |
|---|---:|---:|
| TASK-083 `build ②` (`tests=no -j8 -k`) | 444 | 20 |
| **TASK-084 `build ③`** (`tests=no -j8 -k`) | **191** | **10** |

`project_cross_scene_write.cpp`, `editor_node_batch_write.cpp`, `editor_node_setup.cpp`,
`editor_read_scene_inspector.cpp`, `editor_input_simulation.cpp`, `editor_script_write.cpp`,
`editor_control_layout_write.cpp`, `editor_animation_tree_write.cpp` and `tool_helpers.h`'s hosting
translation units all compile now (object files rebuilt **after** the edits — see the report §5).

## Reproduce

```
python probe.py   <relpath> [a b [rev]]   # read windows of one file
python cmp.py     <relpath> <rev>         # tree vs newest-revision window, line by line
python ev.py      <relpath> [seq]         # recorded write/edit events, full OLD/NEW
python rec.py     <relpath> [--out f]     # replay-based reconstruction + coverage report
python showdiff.py <relpath>              # tree vs reconstruction
python recount84.py <stderr.txt>          # error count + per-file grouping
```

## Iron rules

* Only `H:\rebuild\godot` and `C:\Users\wyl\AppData\Local\Temp\mcp-recovery\` were written.
* `F:` was never written; §6 of the report carries the byte-identical `DECISIONS.md` hash check.
* Builds are started from `cmd.exe` via `Start-Process … -RedirectStandardOutput/-RedirectStandardError`
  (`work\task084\scons_run.ps1`); **no shell redirection** is used for log capture.
* Two accidental `>` redirects happened in scratch commands inside `work\task084\` before the
  launcher existed (`dump_batch.txt`, `blk267.txt`); both scratch files were removed and the
  deviation is recorded in the report.

# REBUILT-2C MANIFEST — 2c-4 (`H:\rebuild\godot`, branch `feature/mcp-server-module-rebuild`)

* Task: TASK-085 (2c-4) — 191 error lines → a green compile and the first runnable exe.
* Start HEAD: `a26cf4fd83`; reached `081f95e65f`.
* Method as 2c-3: **recorded text replayed at its recorded position**; every written fragment is
  marked `// [REBUILT-2C low-confidence: verify]` in code and `REBUILT` below.
* Tooling: `work\task085\` (`evfetch.py`, `replay2.py`, `rebuild.py`, `fix_*.py`, `find_sym.py`).

## Result (measured with the same counter, `recount84.py`)

| build | error lines | files | outcome |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| TASK-084 `build ③` (`tests=no -j8 -k`) | 191 | 10 | red |
| **TASK-085 r7** (`tests=no -j8 -k`) | **0** | **0** | compiles; 5 undefined symbols at link |
| **TASK-085 r12** (`tests=no -j8 -k`) | **0** | **0** | **exit 0 — `bin/godot.windows.editor.x86_64.exe` (179 007 488 B)** |

| **`tests=yes -j8 -k` (last)** | **0** | **0** | **exit 0 — exe 193 225 216 B** |

## Ruling (B) — duplicate generations, later one kept

| file | generation A (discarded) | generation B (kept) | criterion |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tools/tool_helpers.cpp` | 171–193 `VECTOR4`/`VECTOR4I` gen-0 and 390–515 `PACKED_*` gen-2 | the `VECTOR4I`/`QUATERNION` cases moved after line 271 | later **edit order** (`events-edit seq=853`, evidence rev2487 t=1790147836781 lines 184–213) and consistent with the current `switch` |
| `tools/running_game_node_write.cpp` | the earlier `_node_path_for_result` | the later `_node_path_for_result` | later edit order; consistent with the current declaration/schema/registration |
| `tests/test_mcp_server.h` | 9133–9487 — the five `editor_read_scene_inspector` TEST_CASEs at 19 game-scope / 26 editor-process tools | 2941–3583 — the same five at 48 / 76 tools | the kept copy's counts are what the current registration produces; the discarded copy's are the pre-TASK-009/010/011/012 counts |

Discarded-generation summary (content, not bytes): `tool_helpers.cpp` A = a first `VECTOR4`/
`VECTOR4I` dictionary-generation pair and a second PACKED-array generation, both superseded by the
single generation that now stands at 254–320. `running_game_node_write.cpp` A = an
`_node_path_for_result` that took `(Node *, const String &)`. `test_mcp_server.h` A = the
pre-GDR-19 table sizes above.

## Ruling (C) — written, marked, registered

| file | lines | what was written | why it could not be replayed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tools/project_write_resource_scene.cpp` | the `is_label == nullptr` branch of `_write_resource_properties` | 13 lines closing the branch with `-32602` / `-32001` refusals | the tree opens `MCPToolError::invalid_params(vformat(` and then jumps into the older revision's tail; the refusal **sentences** are recorded verbatim (rev775/rev768 windows), the two calls around them are the shape the file's own comment prescribes |
| `tools/project_write_resource_scene.cpp` | `MCPTools::write_resource_properties` | a 10-line adapter over the private `_write_resource_properties` | the header (line 92) exports the name, `_tool_edit_resource` calls it, and the tree only has the private copy — the body is untouched |
| `tools/tool_helpers.cpp` | `schema_with_integer_defaults` closing | `return schema;` + `}` | the rev3233 window stops at `schema["properties"] = properties;`; the return type and the helper's own comment admit no other reading |
| `mcp_jsonrpc.cpp` | `dispatch` | `MCPTrace::Record trace; trace.traceable = p_trace;` + 8 `_tag(..., trace)` wraps | the header declares `dispatch(..., bool p_trace)`; the only recorded definition (rev388 line 311) takes four parameters and predates the trace. The body, `_immediate`, `_tag`, `_effective_timeout`, `_dispatch_tools_call` and `handle` are all recorded text. |
| `mcp_jsonrpc.cpp` | `_dispatch_tools_call` 272–284 | the 13-line gap rebuilt ("Missing tool name" + the arguments guard) | rev453's window has a 13-line hole; the wording is the tree's own recorded `_handle_tools_call` and rev453 line 285 pins the second message |

## Restored verbatim (no marker needed)

|---|---|---|
| `tool_registry.cpp` | whole file (914 lines, 0 breaks) | strict replay of `events-write` + `events-edit` in time order |

# REBUILT-2C MANIFEST — 2c-5 (`H:\rebuild\godot`, branch `feature/mcp-server-module-rebuild`)

* Task: TASK-086 (2c-5) — 21 failing cases / 271 failing assertions → **3 failing cases / 15
  failing assertions**, all three with a recorded cause (see "Open conflicts").
* Start HEAD: `de7e93d06a`; end HEAD `058f618bb2` (this section is the fifth commit).
* Method: unchanged — **recorded text replayed at its recorded position**. Nothing in this
  section is written from memory; every fragment names the event (`seq`/`time`) or the generator
  that produced it.
* Tooling: `work\task086\` (`stat_names.py`, `scopes.py`, `rp.py`, `evlist.py`, `evhit.py`,
  `apply_ev.py`, `apply_tail.py`, `insert_head.py`, `span_from_edit.py`, `fix_counts.py`,
  `fix_log_fixture.py`, `cdiff.py`, `sessions.py`, `reads.py`).
* Logs: `logs\task086_build1..3.*`, `logs\task086_run1..3.*`, baseline `logs\task086_baseline.*`.

## Result (measured)

| run | cases | passed | failed | assertions | passed | failed | exit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline (`de7e93d06a`) | 111 | 90 | 21 | 4370 | 4099 | 271 | 1 |
| after step 1 (registration) | 143 | 124 | 19 | 6381 | 6279 | 102 | 1 |
| after step 2+3 | 143 | 136 | 7 | 6390 | 6368 | 22 | 1 |
| **after step 4 (final)** | **143** | **140** | **3** | **6391** | **6376** | **15** | **1** |

The case count moves 111 → 143 because the baseline run died of SIGSEGV in
`the replay tool validates every event before it waits for a frame` (test_mcp_server.h:6219); with
that tool registered the case completes and the 32 cases after it run for the first time.

## The one root cause of the `-32601` cluster

`work\task086\stat_names.py` compares the `ToolBuilder builder("<name>")` declarations of
`modules/mcp_server/tools/*.cpp` against the contract: **158 of 177 names were declared**. The 19
missing ones are in four group files whose `// BEGIN generated` span was empty or stale:

| # | file | missing | restored from | measured |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `tools/running_game_input.cpp` | 4 | `gen_b2_game_schema.py --group running_game_input --in-place` | 33 270 → 36 295 B |
| 2 | `tools/running_game_observation.cpp` | 6 | `gen_b2_game_schema.py --group running_game_observation --in-place` | 36 845 → 43 267 B |
| 3 | `tools/running_game_assertion.cpp` | 2 | `gen_b2_game_schema.py --group running_game_assertion --in-place` | 32 767 → 36 161 B |
| 4 | `tools/editor_read_scene_inspector.cpp` | 7 | replay of the recorded `C:\…\Temp\t006_gen_reg.py` (events-write seq=593) | placeholder → 7 registrations |

After the four, `177 contract entries = 177 declared, 0 either way` and the live registry measures
exactly what the contract predicts (`work\task086\scopes.py`: 46 `both` + 102 `editor` + 23
`game` + 6 `ADDED_TOOLS` = 177 registered in an editor process, 154 visible to an editor, 73 in a
game process, 50 `both` = the editor view of a game table).

## Restored verbatim (recorded text at its recorded position)

| file | span | recorded source |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/editor_read_scene_inspector.cpp` | `MCPLogSource`, `_log_tail`, `_read_log_source`, `_add_log_source_fields`, both log tools (TASK-026 E-6/G-4) | `events-edit seq=470 t=1790127805398`, 130 → 209 lines; old-tail anchored on `// The tail window of \`read_log_file\``, the `struct` + section comment inserted in front of it |
| `tools/project_read_analysis.cpp` | the whole `project_get_scene_dependencies` block (TASK-024b E-1/G-2) | `events-edit seq=480 t=1790120943437`, 46 → 123 lines; applied to tree span 707–800 after asserting both boundaries |
| `tests/test_mcp_server.h` | the fixture of `editor_get_errors reports the ERROR lines of the log tail` | `events-edit seq=756 t=1790023248440` |
| `tests/test_mcp_server.h` | the fixture of `editor_get_output_log filters the tail case sensitively` | `events-edit seq=758 t=1790023248475` |
| `tests/test_mcp_server.h` | `CHECK(before.size() == 11)` + its own inventory comment in `the analysis tools never write to the project` | `events-edit seq=457 t=1790014377020` |
| `scripts/gen_renamed_contract.py` | the two TASK-068 append-only `DESCRIPTION_OVERRIDES` records | `docs/reports/evidence/task076/contract_fingerprint.txt` lines 20–24 / REPORT-068 §2.3 |
| `tools/running_game_input.cpp`, `tools/running_game_observation.cpp`, `tools/running_game_assertion.cpp`, `tools/running_game_test_execution.cpp` | the whole registration span | `scripts/gen_b2_game_schema.py` over `docs/tools_list.renamed.json` + `docs/tool-rename-map.json` |

## The two log fixtures, and why the third one is absent

`String(const char *)` in this fork is `append_latin1` (`core/string/ustring.h:693`), so a narrow
literal holding non-ASCII bytes produces mojibake. Two of the three log fixtures in the tree were
reconstructed with the bare literal; the recorded final text (seq=756/758) keeps the ASCII half in
`String(...)` and appends `String::utf8(...)` for the CJK line. The third
(`the log tools declare their source and their process`) already used `String(content)` with
`String::utf8(...)` inside and needed nothing.

## Ruling (D) — the stale registry-size assertions are the OLD generation

38 assertions across four test cases still carried the TASK-015/TASK-017 generation of the table
sizes (48 / 76 / 59 / 35 / 31 / 24). They are the old side, on three independent pieces of
evidence:

1. the recorded edit stream of `tests/test_mcp_server.h` contains edit after edit whose whole
   purpose is to move exactly these numbers up as each batch lands - `get_tool_count() == 40` (7
   occurrences at once, `events-edit seq=974 t=1790074265360`), then 175 (`seq=1085
   t=1790298972674`), then 176 (`seq=705 t=1790342829701`);
2. the recorded final-generation numbers 176 / 153 / 72 are exactly 177 / 154 / 73 minus the
   TASK-075 tool (`project_read_text_file`, `scope = both`), i.e. the same quantity one batch
   earlier;
3. `docs/tools_list.renamed.json` + `docs/tool-rename-map.json` predict 177 / 154 / 73 / 50, and
   after the registration recovery the registry measures exactly those numbers.

`work\task086\fix_counts.py` rewrites each of the 39 sites by line number with its expected old
text asserted (the 39th is `source == "no_log_file"` → `"none"`, the TASK-026 marker). Two stale
key-set assertions went with them: `payload["reason"]` (TASK-024 key, replaced by the nine-key
TASK-026 block) → `payload["note"].contains("shared")`, and the same key in the honest-empty
branch → `note.contains("does not exist")`.

## Open conflicts (the three remaining cases, each with its recorded cause)

| case | test side | implementation side (later recording) | judgement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project_edit_resource rewrites an existing resource and skips unknown properties` (8 assertions) | unknown names are skipped, call succeeds - `events-edit seq=596 t=1790166576966` | unknown names are refused `-32001` naming them - `events-edit seq=577 t=1790229749088` | **the test is the older generation**: the implementation recording is 6.3e7 ms later, and TASK-049 D8 is the task that closed the name shape on both sides.

## Iron rules (2c-5)

* Only `H:\rebuild\godot` and `C:\Users\wyl\AppData\Local\Temp\mcp-recovery\` were written.
  `F:` was only *read*: `F:\moonbit-hof-rs\DECISIONS.md` (537 251 B, sha256 `114B2A8218…`) and
  `F:\moonbit-hof-rs\tests\fixtures\mcp\tools_list.json` (48 749 B, sha256 `8F8051C4C0…`, the
  frozen input `gen_renamed_contract.py` re-reads) are byte-identical to the pre-flight values, and
  `Get-PSDrive F` still reports 922 841 124 864 used / 392 138 186 752 free.
* Every build and every Godot run is started from `cmd.exe` via
  `Start-Process -RedirectStandardOutput/-RedirectStandardError`; no log is captured with a shell
  redirection. One deviation is recorded: a single scratch command used `>nul 2>nul` as a no-op
  guard (no file written, nothing captured); the task's own scratch commands use `-OutFile` or the
  wrappers above.
* No destructive command ran at all in this task: every change is a write over an existing file
  with the recorded text as its source, and no file was removed.

# REBUILT-2C MANIFEST — 2c-6 (`H:\rebuild\godot`, branch `feature/mcp-server-module-rebuild`)

* Task: TASK-087 (2c-6) — close TASK-086's step 5, then G6 / G3 / G5 / acceptance.
* Start HEAD: `d82f621fc1`. Tooling: `work\task087\` (`rep.py` UTF-8 reporter, `merge.py`,
  `merge2.py` / `merge3.py`, `editchain.py`, `editmatch.py`, `epoch.py`, `sessions.py`,
  `ps1_parse.ps1`, `verify_dd.py`).
* Method unchanged where the evidence allows it: **recorded text replayed at its recorded
  position**. The one new method this batch is allowed to use is *logical rebuild* for spans the
  evidence genuinely does not carry; every such span is wrapped in
  `// [REBUILT-2C low-confidence: verify] … // [/REBUILT-2C]` (or the file-appropriate comment
  syntax) and listed in the table below with its basis and its behaviour risk.

## E-1. `docs/DESIGN-DETAIL.md` — G3, restored byte-exact (no marker needed)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| before | 31 531 B / 417 lines (the tree copy stopped inside §15's clause table) |
| target | **84 486 B** |
| after | **84 486 B**, sha256 `b8ad40a34a33951b220349ea70ba59fba064ce9fa8b53ed7653b834b33be29c0` |
| basis | **recorded read-window text, not a logical rebuild.** There is no `events-write` row for this path (`reconstruction.jsonl` records `"NO_WRITE_PAYLOAD"`). The 120 recorded read windows cover line numbers **1–1034 with zero holes**; pass A of `merge.py` keeps, for every line number, the text carried by the newest recorded row that has it. |
| cross-check | the independently produced TASK-078 staging body `staging\modules\mcp_server\docs\DESIGN-DETAIL.md` is **byte-identical** (same 84 486 B, same sha256). Two reconstructions from the same index agreeing to the byte is the strongest available evidence, so the residual risk is reset to whether the *recording itself* captured the terminal revision — `epoch.py` shows the newest contributing window is `t=1790349324870`, the newest read of any revision, and every later recorded edit is a no-op on this buffer (0 applied, 0 broken). |
| what was added (the 728 lines the tree had lost) | the §15 clause-table rows for GDR-22/23/24; **§§17–26** in full: GDR-19 B1 framework (17.1–17.4), GDR-20 deferred response channel, GDR-21 input-channel boundary, GDR-22 unified narrowing gate (20.1–20.7), GDR-23 reference-source hierarchy, GDR-24 narrowing-point declaration (22.1–22.4), GDR-25 ergonomics (23.1–23.5), GDR-26 optional server-side call tracing, GDR-27 before/after capture, GDR-28 contract expansion |
| marker | **none** — no byte of this file was invented |
| behaviour risk | none: documentation only, no code path reads it |

## E-2. `scripts/accept_m1.ps1` — G6, `[Parser]::ParseFile` 10 errors → **0**

| item | value |
|---|---|
| before | 57 469 B / 1 008 lines, **10** parse errors (first at `:644` `The Try statement is missing its Catch or Finally block`) |
| after | **49 502 B / 1 022 lines, 0 parse errors** (`[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile`) |
| sha256 | `6e2072ac48ae9f09edb50132fb29cb03a3d52b89cf548181dd7910df71215552` |
| basis | **recorded window text, no logical rebuild.** The damaged body is not repairable by patching — it is a concatenation of *fragments*: `:644` is a stray `}` opening the "Game side" banner, `:665`–`:675` is case 18's body under case 13's label, `:814` and `:875` repeat whole cases, `:886`–`:895` repeats case 13's body, and `:976`–`:1 083` appends one and a half further copies of the `guard_user_port_9877` block *after* `exit 0`. Worse, the union of all 128 recorded windows carries **foreign text**: the `// ---` C++ banner of `tools/editor_shader_write.cpp` (`// TASK-035 (B5 batch 3): the \`editor_shader_write\` group`) appears at line 556 of the union, so a "newest text per line number" merge over every window is contaminated. |
| the fix that made it exact | `epoch.py`/`merge2.py --skeleton N` restrict the merge to windows that belong to **one revision skeleton** (`totalLines <= 1022`), which drops the 5 later-revision windows whose bodies are contaminated. 27 window rows, every line 1–1 022 present, **zero holes**; the result parses with 0 errors. The `totalLines <= 1008` skeleton (17 rows, 48 686 B) also parses with 0 errors and is kept as a second witness. |
| what changed, honestly | the restored body carries **case1–case19** (the M1 case list). Two later cases the damaged copy had already named are **not** re-added: `case0_repo_exit_code_propagation` (TASK-069) and `case20_tools_list_cross_process_restart` (TASK-004). Their text *is* recorded (`events-edit seq=1030 t=1790321324515`, 1 998 B; `seq=858 t=1790015088330`, 3 061 B) and both were grafted experimentally onto the clean base at their recorded anchors, but the graft does **not** reach 0 parse errors (17), so it is **not** what was written. Choosing the parseable recorded revision over a broken superset is the conservative reading; the two cases are therefore recorded here as **not rebuilt**, with their exact event ids, so the next batch can add them deliberately. |
| marker | **none** in the file (the whole body is recorded text); the scope reduction is declared here instead |
| behaviour risk | **low, declared.** `accept_m1.ps1` is a *gate*, not shipped code. The restored gate covers the DESIGN-DETAIL §9 M1 rows plus the hardening rows case15–case19; it does not run the TASK-069 exit-propagation probe or the TASK-004 cross-process-restart probe. `case7_parse_error`/`case11`/`case17`/`case18`/`case19` (the GDR-12 rows) are all present. |

## E-4. TASK-086 step 5 (`d82f621fc1`) — per-hunk ruling, and the three conflict cases closed

The diff of `d82f621fc1` is exactly two files: `tests/test_mcp_server.h` (+127 / −58) and this
manifest. Every hunk of the test file was judged against one rule: **an edit that weakens or
deletes an assertion to make a gate green is reverted; an edit that restores test text the
recording does not carry is rebuilt with a marker.**

| # | hunk | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 38 registry-size assertions `48/76/59/35/31/24` → `73/177/154/50` | **keep** | the replacements are what the contract predicts *and* what the live registry measures (`count=177`, `added_count=6`; the doctest values in §2c-5 §3 are the same numbers). No assertion removed; `work\task087\scan_counts.py` re-measures the file and finds **47 registry-size assertion sites, zero of them carrying a stale value** and no site whose expected value was dropped. The recorded edit stream moves exactly these numbers batch by batch (`events-edit seq=974/1085/705`). |
| 2 | `the analysis tools never write to the project`: `before.size() == 13` → `11` (+2 comment lines) | **keep** | the fixture is `ScratchProject`, whose inventory is 11; 13 is `ReadFilesProject`'s (the case below it). The guraded quantity did not change, only the number was wrong. |
| 3 | `payload["reason"]` → `payload["note"].contains("shared")`, and `"no_log_file"` → `"none"` + `note.contains("does not exist")` | **keep** | TASK-026 removed the TASK-024 `reason` key; the replacement asserts on the key the recorded `_add_log_source_fields` / `_read_log_source` actually write. Two assertions became two assertions — nothing weakened. |
| 4 | the two `ScratchLog` fixtures, bare narrow literal → `String(...) + String::utf8(...)` | **keep** | this fork's `String(const char *)` is `append_latin1` (`core/string/ustring.h:693`), so the old text put mojibake in the log and the byte-exact CJK filters could never match. The recorded final text is `events-edit seq=756/758`. |
| 5 | **the three stale explanatory comments step 5 left behind** | **rebuilt, marked** | the commit moved the assertions but not the prose that explains them: `:1419` still said "the game-process table carries the 23 both-scope tools plus the 17 game-scope ones" above `== 73`; `:4664` still said "66 → 76 registered, 49 → 59 visible" above `== 177 / == 154`; `:7759` still said "76 registered tools, 59 of them visible" above `== 177 / == 154`. Each is now realigned to the counts its own assertions use and wrapped in `// [REBUILT-2C low-confidence: verify] … // [/REBUILT-2C]`. These are the only text this batch wrote rather than replayed. |

**Reverts: none.** No hunk of `d82f621fc1` was found to weaken or delete an assertion, so nothing
was rolled back.

### The three conflict cases (TASK-086's "Open conflicts")

All three were *test side = older generation, implementation side = newer recording, updated test
text absent from the recording*. Under this batch's authorization they are closed by **logical
rebuild against the tool's declared schema and its live behaviour**, each wrapped in
`// [REBUILT-2C low-confidence: verify] … // [/REBUILT-2C]`:

| case | old test text (recorded) | what the implementation does (recorded, later) | what was written | why this is the conservative reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `project_edit_resource rewrites an existing resource …` | unknown names skipped, call succeeds (`seq=596 t=1790166576966`) | refuses `-32001` naming the name (`seq=577 t=1790229749088`, TASK-049 D8) | case renamed to `… rewrites an existing resource`; the unknown-name half moved into the second case as a refusal block asserting `result == NIL`, `code == -32001`, `message.contains(name)`, `data.suggestion` present and containing `is not a property of`, and **the file unchanged** | the refusal is a strictly *stronger* claim than the skip was; the "nothing on disk moved" half is preserved, and the resource's real write path is still asserted end to end (byte image changed, reload sees the new value). The suggestion text is the recorded `not_found(...)` wording in `tools/project_write_resource_scene.cpp:592-596`, not invented. |
| `project_edit_resource reports no change and validates its arguments` | same | same | the unknown-name block added (as above) plus an **empty-bag** block asserting `message == "No properties were changed"` and `changed.is_empty()` | the empty bag is the one case the implementation's short circuit is honest for (`project_write_resource_scene.cpp:718-729`), so both branches now have a case instead of one branch being tested twice. |
| `project_read_resource reports the loaded resource type` | TASK-024 E-9 shape: `properties_total` / `properties_count` / `properties_truncated` / `properties_limit == 256` / `properties_byte_limit == 256*1024` (`seq=600 t=1790101526117`) | TASK-026 shape: `total_properties` / `truncated` / `dropped` / `limits.max_properties == 64` (`seq=445/450 t=1790127763038/1790127766391`) | the five key/cap assertions rewritten to the published shape: `total_properties == 2`, `total_properties == properties.size()`, `truncated == false`, `dropped == 0`, `limits.max_properties == 64`; the value halves (`properties.size() == 2`, the two member checks, `resource_path` absent) are unchanged | read straight out of `tools/project_read_files.cpp:789-795` (`MAX_RESOURCE_PROPERTIES = 64`, no byte budget). The cap is the tool's own constant; the count assertion is a tautology-free `total_properties == properties.size()` where the old pair had two independently-wrong numbers. |

## E-5. Gate ledger (TASK-087, real output)

| gate | command | result |
|---|---|---|
| module doctest | `--headless --test --test-case=[MCPServer]*` | **exit 0** — `143 / 143 passed / 0 failed`, `6396 / 6396` assertions, `SUCCESS!` |
| full engine doctest | `--headless --test` | **exit 0** — `1569 / 1569 passed / 0 failed / 3 skipped`, `430702 / 430702` assertions, `SUCCESS!`, no `FATAL` / `SIGSEGV` in stdout or stderr |
| group manifest | `docs/scripts/check_tool_groups.py` | **PASS** (`TOOL-GROUPS CHECK PASS`, 5681 B, sha `b83d79d3…`) |
| contract subset (live) | `scripts/check_contract_subset.ps1` | **3/3 PASS** — editor 9888 `154 == 154`, game 9889 `73 == 73`, verbatim; `guard_user_port_9877` `pid_before=-1 pid_after=-1`; `contract=177` |
| rename map | `docs/scripts/check_rename_map.py` | **PASS** (`all checks green`; G5/G6 re-derive `177 == 174 - 2 - 1 + 6`) |
| tautologies | `scripts/check_tautologies.py` | **PASS** (`every hit is pinned; scanned=2 file kind(s) under 2 root(s)`) |
| exit-code propagation | `scripts/check_exit_propagation.py` (+ `--probes`) | **PASS** (`every aggregator shape is guarded or pinned`) / `PROBES: 10/10` |
| hardcoded counts | `scripts/check_hardcoded_counts.py` | **FAIL (1 unclassified line)** — pre-existing and independently recorded: `docs/scripts/_tmp_gen_b3_b5.py:282` contains the literal `171` in a comment ("`docs/tools_list.renamed.json (171 entries) …`"). That is a `_tmp_` scratch generator, not a contract consumer, and TASK-086's report §5.4 already listed exactly this item as *not done*. Nothing in this batch touched it; it is reported as a known red rather than silenced. |
| engine anchor | `scripts/check_engine_anchor.ps1` | not run (rebuilds the mono binary; out of this batch's scope, unchanged from TASK-086) |
| M1 acceptance | `scripts/accept_m1.ps1` | **16 / 20 cases**, exit 1 — four FAILs, all four are the script's own **M1-era expectations** meeting the now-complete registry. Detail below. |

### E-5.2 `accept_m1.ps1` — the four remaining FAILs, with their measured values

The script now parses (E-2) and runs end to end. Four cases fail; each one is the *script's*
expectation being the M1 generation while the live answer is the TASK-075 registry:

| case | script expects | live answer (measured) | judgement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `case1_GET_mcp_200` | the status body's `tools` count is the 2 M1 tools | `{"connections":1,"frame_count":211,"is_editor":true,"listening":true,"pending":0,"pending_connections":0,"port":9888,"server":"godot-mcp-rs","status":"ok","**tools":154**,"transport":"streamable-http"}` | **script is the old generation.** `tools: 154` is exactly `get_visible_tool_count(true)`, the number the module doctest asserts and the contract predicts. Nothing on the wire is wrong. |
| `case3_tools_list_fixture` | the listing holds the 2 M1 tools | `tools=154`, and the two it checks are `name_verbatim=True inputSchema_verbatim=True description_verbatim=True` | same. The verbatim half of the case **passes**; only the count is stale. |
| `case12_game_process_endpoint` | the game listing holds the M1 game subset | `status=200 is_editor=False`, `initialize` verbatim, and the game endpoint lists what E-5.1's gate compares verbatim; the failing half is a count against the same 2/6-era expectation | same. This is the **same defect as `check_contract_subset`'s**, from the script side: it compares against a hand-maintained M1 list instead of the manifests. |
| `guard_user_port_9877` | `pid_before -gt 0` ("the user's editor is present") | `listening=False pid_before=-1 pid_after=-1` | **script is the old generation.** The user's editor listener on 9877 was retired during the project; the correct invariant is "this script never touches 9877", which `check_contract_subset.ps1`'s own guard states positively as `pid_before=-1 pid_after=-1` and passes. |

**Not fixed in this batch, and why:** repairing these four means rewriting the script's expected
tool sets to be **derived from the manifests** (the way `$ToolNames` already is at the top of the
file) instead of the M1 literal `2`, plus inverting the 9877 guard to the 9877-retired
invariant. That is a change to the gate's *assertions*, so it belongs to a batch that can rebuild
and re-run the whole acceptance; this batch's authorization covers logical rebuild of *missing
text*, and none of these four is missing text — they are positively-wrong expectations with a
recorded later generation on the other side. They are reported as **red with cause**, not
silenced, and the invariant they were meant to protect **is** asserted and passing elsewhere:
`check_contract_subset.ps1` proves `154 == 154` / `73 == 73` verbatim on both endpoints and the
9877 guard, and the module doctest proves the same numbers at the registry level.

### E-5.1 The two missing group manifests (and why the gate was red)

`check_contract_subset.ps1` first failed **2/3** with the registry reading *stronger* than the
gate's expectation: `editor port=9888 tools=154 … tool count actual=154 expected_for_editor=91`
and `game port=9889 tools=73 … expected_for_game=53`. The cause was not the registry. The script
reads six manifests and **two were absent from this tree**:

| manifest | before | after | recorded fingerprint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/tool-groups-b5.json` | absent | 12 012 B → 12 005 B | 12 209 B, sha `85bb783e…` |
| `docs/tool-groups-added.json` | absent | 8 506 B | 9 478 B, sha `72d0c8ae…` |

Both were recovered from the TASK-078 staging reconstruction of the same paths (nothing
invented). That moved the union to 141/61, still 14 short; the remaining 14 contract tools sit in
**8 b5 groups whose `implemented` flag was still `false`** although all 14 are registered and
live. `work\task087\fix_b5_flags.py` flips exactly those eight
(`editor_navigation_write`, `project_theme_write`, `project_theme_read`, `project_export_read`,
`project_android_read`, `os_android_read`, `os_android_write`,
`running_game_navigation_write`) and no other group; the original bytes are preserved at
`work\task087\tool-groups-b5.json.orig`. The manifest is 12 005 B after the rewrite (12 012 B
before) — the 7-byte delta is JSON re-serialisation only, every group name, tool name and
`scope` is unchanged. The gate then read `implemented_union=154 tools (editor endpoint) / 73
tools (game endpoint)` and **3/3 checks passed**.

**Declared risk:** the flag flip is a *gate-metadata* correction, not a behaviour change. Its
justification is not the manifest itself but the live measurement it is compared against: the
registry serves exactly the 177 contract entries, `154` to an editor and `73` to a game, with
zero leakage in either direction, and both endpoints compare **verbatim** (name / description /
inputSchema) against `docs/tools_list.renamed.json`. Before the flip the gate could not state that
invariant at all.

## E-3. `scripts/gen_renamed_contract.py` / G5 — the shape gate passes; 10 overrides stay missing

| item | value |
|---|---|
| generator | `scripts/gen_renamed_contract.py`, 125 454 B, `GENERATOR_VERSION = "1.22.0"` |
| contract | `docs/tools_list.renamed.json`, 136 641 B, sha256 `368cd3c792916088c09e837a12582cde1252e14f6c9ad02110c97059e641b907` |
| shape gate | **passes**: `count=177`, `added_count=6`, `generator_version=1.22.0`, 177 tool entries, editor-visible **154** / game-visible **73** (rename map 174 entries: 47 `both` + 103 `editor` + 24 `game`; `+6 ADDED_TOOLS` → 50 `both`, 104 `editor`, 23 `game` ⇒ 154 / 73), and **idempotent**: two consecutive `python gen_renamed_contract.py` runs both exit 0 and leave the same 136 641 B / same sha256. The generator's own self-checks report `lint 177/177, unique 177/177, disposition enum OK`. |
| recorded artefact | `docs/reports/evidence/task076/contract_fingerprint.txt`: **163 520 B**, sha256 `a5c59853c1e5a4913d600c663c8e972f058f7144869ec20337ab41b7a7bb17ea`, `_meta.overrides = 36`, generator 1.22.0 |
| diff, as measured | **27 879 bytes smaller** (136 641 vs 163 520), `_meta.overrides` **26 vs 36**, all other meta scalars equal (`count 177`, `added_count 6`, `generator_version 1.22.0`, `tool_count_in 174`, `excluded [navigate_to, export_project]`, `merged 1`). The rename-map sha256 the generator prints is `2f552719…` — **identical** to the pinned fingerprint, so the name/scope input is right. |
| what could NOT be replayed, and why | the 10 missing `_meta.overrides` records. Their **names are not in this tree's evidence**: `contract_fingerprint.txt` pins only the array's *length* (36), and there is **no recorded whole-file write of the contract** (`events-write.jsonl` has 0 rows for `docs/tools_list.renamed.json`). `runtime\work\task087\ovkeys.py` harvested every tool-name token near an `overrides` mention across `events-termdump`, `gen-runs`, `events-diff` and `events-termfile` — 109 distinct tokens, all of them names that the **already-present** 26 overrides cover or names from unrelated reports, so no 10-missing set can be identified with evidence. **No override was invented.** |
| second candidate, rejected | the TASK-078 staging body `staging\modules\mcp_server\scripts\gen_renamed_contract.py` (118 449 B) is the **read-epoch of an older generation**: `GENERATOR_VERSION = "1.3.0"`, 9 `DESCRIPTION_OVERRIDES` + 13 `SCHEMA_OVERRIDES` (with `play_scene` duplicated). The tree generator is a strict superset of it (14 + 12, every staging key present), so nothing was gained by swapping. `reconstruction.jsonl` already marked it `"SWAPPED_BY_SYNTAX_CHECK"`, `"conf": "low"`, `"DOWNGRADED_TO_LOW(47 failed edits)"`. |
| a second, independent reason the sha cannot match | `_meta.map_path` is the **absolute path of the working tree**: the pinned contract records the recorded build root `F:\RustProjects\godot-mcp-pro\code\godot\modules\mcp_server\docs\tool-rename-map.json`, while this tree writes `H:\rebuild\godot\modules\mcp_server\docs\tool-rename-map.json`. That field alone is 24 bytes shorter *and* makes a byte-identical regeneration impossible by construction, whatever the overrides do. |
| marker | no code marker is needed (nothing was written into the generator); the shortfall is declared here |
| behaviour risk | **none for the gate.** The shape gate is defined on `count` / `added_count` / `generator_version` / the editor-game split / idempotency, and all five hold. The risk is *provenance*: the contract cannot yet be shown to be the byte image the task076 audit pinned, because 10 override records (≈7.4 KB by their mean entry size) and the environment-dependent `map_path` account for the measured 27 879 B gap. |
