#  accept_m1.ps1 -- independent acceptance run for M1 of modules/mcp_server
#
#  Covers every row of DESIGN-DETAIL.md §9 (14 rows), plus hardening cases that
#  are not part of §9 (connection reaping, `Expect: 100-continue`, 431 for an
#  oversized header, 400 for a bare LF header terminator, and the verbose
#  warning for a non-UTF-8 body), plus a guard that the user's own editor on
#  port 9877 is left untouched.
#
#  TASK-004 §3.1 adds `case20_tools_list_cross_process_restart`: the *same*
#  build served by two *independent* engine processes (the editor is stopped and
#  started again on the same port/project) must answer `tools/list` with
#  byte-identical response bodies. The pre-existing determinism cases only
#  compare calls made to one running process (§17.4), so a build whose listing
#  order depended on, say, a hash seed used at startup would have slipped
#  through.
#
#  Port discipline (see ACCEPTANCE.md "environment facts"):
#    * the editor owned by the user listens on 9877 and must never be touched;
#    * this script therefore uses 9888 (editor side) / 9889 (game side) only;
#    * the default-port logic (9877) is covered by unit tests, never by binding.
#
#  The script only ever kills the PIDs it started itself.
#
#  Reference contract: the equality gate compares against
#  `modules/mcp_server/docs/tools_list.renamed.json`. That file is generated
#  mechanically from the old hof-rs fixture
#  `F:\moonbit-hof-rs\tests\fixtures\mcp\tools_list.json` by
#  `modules/mcp_server/scripts/gen_renamed_contract.py`. The v1.2 generator is
#  still a name-only rewrite plus **7 append-only description discriminators**
#  (R-1/R-2/R-3, TASK-002 section 2.1); inputSchema is carried over character for
#  character everywhere and every description is still compared verbatim, so the
#  strictness of the gate is unchanged. The old fixture stays on the provenance
#  chain as `_meta.generated_from` and `_meta.overrides` lists the 7 reasons.
#
#  Gate scope (R-4): the verbatim comparison covers the tools listed in
#  `$ToolNames` (the implemented ones), never the whole 171 entry contract. The
#  SUMMARY prints "implemented tools N / contract 171" and marks the deviation
#  explicitly, so a per-batch green can never be read as a full-contract green.
#
#  TASK-006 §2 adds the process dimension: `$ToolNames` is the *editor*
#  endpoint's union, `$GameToolNames` is the same union minus the tools whose
#  `scope` is `editor` (docs/tool-rename-map.json is the authority for scope).
#  `case12_game_process_endpoint` compares the game `tools/list` against
#  `$GameToolNames`, asserts that no editor-scope tool leaked into it, and calls
#  one of them to prove the refusal is -32601 rather than execution.
#
#  TASK-010 §1/§4 - B2 opened with the game-side observation group plus the E3
#  lever `running_game_execute_gdscript`. Those tools are all `scope = game`, so
#  they are absent from the editor endpoint's listing and present on the game
#  endpoint's; the derived expectations (`$EditorToolNames` / `$GameToolNames` /
#  the two only-lists) follow from the rename map, so every comparison case keeps
#  working unchanged and no assertion is weakened.
#
#  TASK-018 §2 removed the hand-maintained literal this paragraph used to point
#  at: `$ToolNames` is derived from the group manifests (see the block where it
#  is built), so a new batch no longer edits this file at all. The per-batch
#  manifests are `docs/tool-groups.json` and its `-b2`/`-b3`/`-b4`/`-b5` sisters;
#  this script still does not *decode* them beyond the tools of the groups marked
#  `implemented: true`, and the rename map remains the authority for `scope`.
#
#  Known engine facts this script works around (documented, not hidden):
#    * `SocketServer::MAX_PENDING_CONNECTIONS` is 8, so more than 8 connections
#      that are simultaneously pending while a frame is busy get reset by
#      Windows. The concurrency case therefore uses 8 parallel connections with
#      pipelined requests (100 requests in flight at once), and waits for the
#      editor's main loop to pump steadily before starting.
#    * the captured snapshot in hof-rs is the authoritative fixture and is
#      compared *verbatim*: name, description and inputSchema must match
#      character for character (case included).  An earlier revision of this
#      script also accepted the Latin-1 recovery of a description double
#      encoded by a PowerShell round trip; that fallback made the gate unable
#      to reject a server emitting mojibake, and it also silently covered the
#      nested descriptions inside `inputSchema`.  The fixture has since been
#      re-captured as clean UTF-8 (GDR-13), so both the fallback and the
#      double encoding are gone.
#    * "the connection is closed after 413" is proven *positively*: a read
#      timeout is not evidence of closure - the same idiom reports "closed" on a
#      keep-alive connection that is demonstrably alive (GDR-12.1).  The check
#      therefore requires a zero length read (FIN), a reset, a failed write, or
